![new](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b9b43fb-0c6d-401c-9153-1ead1275297a)


Copy the code and paste it into the Arduino IDE

Click Upload to upload the code to the ESP8266 board


## Step 6: Select the ESP8266 Board

Go to Tools > Board > ESP8266 > NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)

Wait for the upload process to complete


## Step 8: Verify the Evil Twin AP

Open your Windows Wi-Fi settings and look for a network named "TPlinksecure"

The password for this network is "mafia007"



# Starting the Evil Twin Attack


## Step 1: Access the Evil Twin Interface

Open a web browser and type "192.168.4.1" in the address bar

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efdca968-7002-41d6-aa2d-747abf894d44)



You will see an interface similar to the one shown above:


## Step 2: Select the Target and Start the Evil Twin

Select your target and start the evil twin attack

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3514c45f-80aa-4cf0-87ec-cec60fd6e343)


You will be disconnected from the webpages and see the mimicked legitimate AP on your Wi-Fi list

## Step 3: Redirect to the Fake AP

When the victim tries to access the fake AP, they will be redirected to the password entering page that we  created earlier

![hi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85cb67aa-a67b-40ac-9412-2029fcd7346d)

After submitting correct password the fake ap will be fade away and the password be shown in the gui interface where we selected the targetb


## Step 4: Capture the Password

After the victim enters the correct password, the fake AP will fade, and you can access the password by typing "192.168.4.1" in the address bar
