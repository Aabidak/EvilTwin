## Project Overview 📝

This repository contains a project that demonstrates an Evil Twin Attack using an ESP8266 microcontroller 💻.
The Evil Twin Attack is a type of wireless attack where an attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one,
allowing them to intercept and manipulate communication between devices 📱.

## Project Description 📄

In this project, we use an ESP8266 board to create a rogue Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one 📡.
The ESP8266 is programmed to broadcast a Wi-Fi network with the same SSID as a legitimate network,
making it difficult for users to distinguish between the two 🔒. 
Once a user connects to the rogue network, the attacker can intercept and manipulate their internet traffic


 ## Features 🎉
 
• ESP8266-based rogue Wi-Fi access point 📡

• Allows for interception and manipulation of internet traffic 📊

• Mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network with the same SSID 🔒

## Hardware Requirements 🛠️

• ESP8266 microcontroller board 💻 

• Wi-Fi antenna (Optional) 📡

• Power supply (Using USB Cable) 💡

## Software Requirements 💻

• Arduino IDE 📊 

• Wi-Fi library for ESP8266 (Hardware) 💻
